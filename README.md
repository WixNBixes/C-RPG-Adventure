# C-RPG-Adventure

I'm working on making a full UI based RPG similar to the text based Python one that I have made. At the moment it's very bare bones, but I am working on expanding the features when I have the time.
Current features:
  Shop, training, fighting and sleeping set up and interactable between each other
